/**
 * Encapsulates the concept of a contiguous series of actions performed, or to

 *
 * {@link DBAction} encapsulates the concept of an action, but has no concept of
 * sequence. DBActionList provides the concept of sequence and allows it to be
 * reversed.
 *
 * <p>
 * DBActionList does not provide for complex processing of rows and actions, use
 * {@link DBScript} for that.
 *
 * <p>
 * Similarly DBActionList does not provide transactional integrity, that is
 * provided by {@link DBTransaction}.
 *
 * <p>
 * DBActionList are designed to provide a revert script for actions performed or
 * to accumulate actions that are executed as a batch with {@link DBActionList#execute(nz.co.gregs.dbvolution.databases.DBDatabase)
 * }.
