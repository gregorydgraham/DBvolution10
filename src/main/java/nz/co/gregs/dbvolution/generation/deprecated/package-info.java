/**
 * Automatically Create DBRow Classes Based An Existing Schema.
 * <p>
 * To use DBV, first create a connection to your database using the DBDatabase
 * subclasses in {@link nz.co.gregs.dbvolution.databases}.
 * <p>
 * With the the DBDatabase you can create to DBRow classes required from the
 * database schema using
 * {@link nz.co.gregs.dbvolution.generation.DBTableClassGenerator} or you can
 * write you own. There are examples to start from in
 * {@link nz.co.gregs.dbvolution.example}.
 * <p>
 * I've been writing SQL for 20 years and DBV is easier, I hope you like it.
